## Base Idea
ScrapLab is an [[Environmentally Friendly]] [[High-Tech]] project with the goal of solving the problem of PPE(Personal Protection Equipment) disposal.
It will achieve its goal with the use of a web based technological platform and with the use of smart disposal bins named SLDMs([[ScrapLab Disposal Machine]]s). The web platform will be used to coordinate the SLDMs and ensure a safe and effective waste collection. The collected waste will then be brought to specialized sites that will dispose of the waste.
